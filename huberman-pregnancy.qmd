# Fertility Crisis
Is there a fertility crisis? Bryan Caplan suggests to [have more kids](https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616) and recently posted [The Fertile Formula](https://www.betonit.ai/p/how-much-would-this-raise-fertility), an idea to reduce federal taxes based on how many kids you have, getting to income tax-free for life after six kids. Great deal!

# Andrew Huberman Calculates Pregnancy Probability
If you were guaranteed a pregnancy after five attempts, it would be an even better deal! Which is what Andrew Huberman was implying while discussing pregnancy probabilities in a recent video: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andrew Huberman says that having sex 6 times gives you a 120% chance of getting pregnant<br><br>Multiply that by his 6 girlfriends and we have a 120% chance of having 36 Hubermans after 6 years<br><br>Population crisis solved <a href="https://t.co/m1u5qgmwUJ">https://t.co/m1u5qgmwUJ</a></p>&mdash; BuccoCapital Bloke (@buccocapital) <a href="https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1788575303889035600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He was specifically talking about cumulative probabilities and he said that if the 
$\Pr(\text{Pregnancy}) = 0.2$ per attempt, then the $\Pr(\text{Pregnancy})$ after $6$ attempts is $1.2$, i.e. $120\%$. 

In other words, he did this: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\text{Preg after 6 attempts}) &= 6 * \Pr(\text{Preg after 1 attempt}) \\
  &= 6 * 0.2 \\
  &= 1.2 \\
  &= 120\%
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

## Huberman Calculation Issues
There are many issues here. To start, since probabilities are by definition between $0$ and $1$, he clearly made an error. $10$ pregnancy attempts by his logic would make you $200\%$ likely to be pregnant, which doesn't really make too much sense. 

Huberman was *adding* $20\%$ for each attempt, which is not the correct approach. In this post, we'll explain how the actual theory works. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I made a visualization for you all. <a href="https://t.co/LMTECq70HZ">https://t.co/LMTECq70HZ</a> <a href="https://t.co/IGIL1HyGQl">pic.twitter.com/IGIL1HyGQl</a></p>&mdash; Matthew B Jan√© (@MatthewBJane) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewBJane/status/1789015382230991289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Huberman Correction
He since posted a [Twitter correction](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1788964558758965281) and has updated the original videos. 

# Correctly Calculating Pregnancy Probabilities
We're not here to critique an error, but rather to LEARN PROBABILITY! So how DO you calculate this probability? 

For a single attempt, we use the Huberman assumption that $\Pr(\text{Pregnancy}) = 0.2$. We'll define this as $p = 0.2$. 

We also then know that $\Pr(\text{No Pregnancy}) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$. 

## 6 Pregnancy Attempts 
So after $6$ attempts, we can say that the $\Pr(\text{Preg after 6 attempts})$ is equal to the inverse of the probability of *not* getting pregnant $6$ times in a row. Why? The probability of an event and its complement always sum to $1$. For example, if it's $70\%$ to be sunny tomorrow, then it's $30\%$ to be not-sunny. 

Mathematically, we can write: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\text{Preg after 6 attempts}) &= 1 - \Pr(\text{Not Preg after 6 attempts}) \\
  &= 1 - (0.8)^6 \\
  &= 0.738 \\
  &= 73.8\%
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

### Independent Probabilities 
Why is it $1 - (0.8)^6$? This is because when we are calculating probabilities involving independent events, they are multiplied. Each case of not becoming pregnant has an independent probability of $0.8$ (note that this is a simplification because probabilities would generally vary for each attempt). Multiplying this $6$ times gets us the probability of *not* being pregnant after $6$ attempts. So to get the probability *of* being pregnant after $6$ attempts, we take $1$ minus this, therefore getting $1 - (0.8)^6$. 

## x Pregnancy Attempts
More generally, after $x$ attempts, we can say:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\text{Preg after x attempts}) &= 1 - \Pr(\text{Not Preg after x attempts}) \\
  &= 1 - (1-0.2)^x \\
  &= 1 - (0.8)^x
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

## 99% Likelihood of Pregnancy
So assuming that $\Pr(\text{Pregnancy}) = 0.2$, when are you $99\%$ to be pregnant? 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 0.99 &= 1 - \Pr(\text{Not Preg after x attempts}) && \Rightarrow \text{ Set pregnancy likelihood to } 0.99 \\
      &= 1 - (0.8)^x && \Rightarrow \text{ Use equation from above } \\
  0.99 + (0.8)^x &= 1 && \Rightarrow \text{ Add } 0.8^x \text{ to both sides} \\
  (0.8)^x &= 0.01 && \Rightarrow \text{ Subtract } 0.99 \text{ from both sides} \\
  x &= 20.64 && \Rightarrow \text{ Use calculator to solve}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore after **$21$** pregnancy attempts where each attempt has a $20\%$ likelihood, your cumulative likelihood of being pregant exceeds $99\%$. (We round up from $20.64$ because each one is discrete and at $20$ the probability would be under $99\%$, so only *after* $20.64$ does it exceed $99\%$, which means it exceeds at attempt $21$.)

We can see this on the graph below where $\Pr(\text{Pregnancy}) = 0.2$. The x-axis is the number of attempts and the y-axis is the cumulative (overall) probability of pregnancy after that many attempts. Note that the graph approaches, but will never exceed the probability of $1$.

## Generalized Pregnancy Equation
Finally, even more generally, we can say that after $ x $ attempts and the more general $\Pr(\text{Pregnancy}) = p$ (i.e. using probability $p$ instead of $0.2$): 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Pr(\text{Preg after x attempts}) &= 1 - \Pr(\text{Not Preg after x attempts}) \\
  &= 1 - (1-p)^x \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
