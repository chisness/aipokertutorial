The probability of an event and its complement always sum to \\(1\\). For example, if it’s \\(70\\%\\) to be sunny tomorrow, then it’s \\(30\\%\\) to be not-sunny.\nMathematically, we can write:\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\Pr(\\text{Preg after 6 attempts}) &= 1 - \\Pr(\\text{Not Preg after 6 attempts}) \\\\\n  &= 1 - (0.8)^6 \\\\\n  &= 0.738 \\\\\n  &= 73.8\\%\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\nIndependent Probabilities\nWhy is it $ 1 - (0.8)^6 $? This is because when we are calculating probabilities involving independent events, they are multiplied. Each case of not becoming pregnant has an independent probability of $ 0.8 $ (note that this is a simplification because probabilities would generally vary for each attempt). Multiplying this \\(6\\) times gets us the probability of not being pregnant after \\(6\\) attempts.
